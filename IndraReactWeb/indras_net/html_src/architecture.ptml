  <h3>
    The User, the Menu, and the Environment
  </h3>

  <p>
    The
    <a href="https://github.com/gcallah/Indra/blob/master/indra/user.py">
      user
    </a>
    is of course given control to run the program and to display its data.
    But the key idea here is that the "user" appears as another node in
    Indra's net, meaning the agents can conceivably "see" the user and
    interact with him/her.
    His primary method of interface is through the
    <a href="https://github.com/gcallah/Indra/blob/master/indra/menu.py">
      menu
    </a>, but more complicated interactions are possible.

  <h3>
    Graphics Capabilities
  </h3>
  <p>
    We currently have fairly extensive graphics capabilities built in
    to the system through
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matplotlib">
      matplotlib.
    </a>
    These include plotting changes in agent populations, tracing agent
    movement (live) on a scatter plot, and examining the
    object-hierarchy at play in a program at any point in time.
